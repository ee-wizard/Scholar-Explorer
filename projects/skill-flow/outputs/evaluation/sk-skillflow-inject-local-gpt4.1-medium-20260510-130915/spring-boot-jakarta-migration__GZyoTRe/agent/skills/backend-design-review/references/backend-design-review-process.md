    email VARCHAR(100),  -- no unique constraint
    balance FLOAT,  -- precision issues for money
    created DATETIME  -- no timezone
);

    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    balance DECIMAL(19, 4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

);
```

- [ ] Query complexity reasonable (avoid deeply nested subqueries)

**Example N+1 Query Problem:**

users = db.query("SELECT * FROM users")

# N queries to get orders for each user
for user in users:
    orders = db.query(f"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = {user.id}")
```

✅ **Good (2 queries with batching or 1 query with join):**

```python
# Approach 1: Batching (2 queries)
users = db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
user_ids = [user.id for user in users]
orders = db.query(f"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id IN ({user_ids})")

# Approach 2: Join (1 query)
results = db.query("""
    SELECT u.*, o.*
    FROM users u
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
""")
```
